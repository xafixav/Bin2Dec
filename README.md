# Bin2Dec

- [Link to the project in vercel](https://bin2-dec-4jbp.vercel.app/)


**Tier:** 1-Beginner

Binary is the number system all digital computers are based on.
Therefore it's important for developers to understand binary, or base 2,
mathematics. The purpose of Bin2Dec is to provide practice and
understanding of how binary calculations.

Bin2Dec allows the user to enter strings of up to 8 binary digits, 0's
and 1's, in any sequence and then displays its decimal equivalent.

This challenge requires that the developer implementing it follow these
constraints:

-   Arrays may not be used to contain the binary digits entered by the user
-   Determining the decimal equivalent of a particular binary digit in the
    sequence must be calculated using a single mathematical function, for
    example the natural logarithm. It's up to you to figure out which function
    to use.

## User Stories

-   [x] User can enter up to 8 binary digits in one input field
-   [x] User must be notified if anything other than a 0 or 1 was entered
-   [x] User views the results in a single output field containing the decimal (base 10) equivalent of the binary number that was entered

## Bonus features

-   [x] User can enter a variable number of binary digits

  <summary>How to run locally the project.</summary>
  
 This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
